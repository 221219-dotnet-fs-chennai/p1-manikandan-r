# TITLE: TRAINER PICKER

## EXPLANATION:

This is a Trainer Selector Project, I named it has **Trainer Picker**. Pursope of this project is Displaying various trainers with various skills or Register yourself as a Trainer. If you want to learn some new skill or do a project on specific field you can hire a trainer to do the work by searching the trainer by using this application, And also if you want to work as a trainer, My application has an option to register yourself as a Trainer and people can hire you as their Trainer. You can search a *Trainer* or you become a *Trainer*, for that purpose I developed this application. 
This application has a seperate option for a *Trainer* and a general user. If you're a trainer it has options like **signup** for new trainer and **login** for existing user. In **signup** it asks for trainer General details (like firstname, lastname, age etc.), Education details, Skills that Trainer have and Work details. If Trainer choose **login** they can view their profile, edit their profile, delete any particular field or delete their entire profile. For normal users they can see all trainers or they can filter the trainer by city/skill/company. This is the overview of my project 0.
